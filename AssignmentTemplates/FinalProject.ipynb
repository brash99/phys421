    "In the Jupyter Notebook called Fitting_Examples.ipynb (you can find this in the ~/JupyterNotebooks/fitting directory), the last few examples considered cases where the uncertainty in the data became larger at small x-values. We considered three scenarios for collecting the data - one where we focused on small x-values, and two others that covered larger ranges of x.\n",

    "For this question, begin with the Jupyter Notebook above, and modify it to consider 10 x-value ranges that keep the minimum value of the range constant (and fairly close to zero) while varying the maximum x-value from small to larger values. For each x-value range, calculate the uncertainty in the y-intercept, and then create a plot of the uncertainty as a function of that maximum x-value of the range.\n",

    "My current vehicle is a 2016 Mazda CX-5.  I purchased an ODB reader unit earlier this year, in order to diagnose the sources of a \"Check Engine Light\" situation.  In once instance last August, I recorded some data using the ODB reader, and then exported this data into a CSV file, in the format the the ODB reader manufacturer specified.   You can find that data file in ~/JupyterNotebooks/ODB/Mazda_CX5_2016_08122022.csv\n",

    "\n",
    "The task for this question is for you to look at ALL of the data recorded, and then create plots of quantities that you think might be useful or interesting, as a function of recording time.  In particular, it should be interesting to look at the CORRELATIONS between various PID signals.  That is, Incidentally, the Check Engine code that was thrown that sent me down the path was related to an under-performing catalytic converter.  This is why I recorded data for the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors, and the catalytic converter temperature.\n",

    "This is an open-ended task, and there is no right answer here!  The point is for you to exercise your sense of creativity, together with your knowledge of data analysis techniques that you may have learned in this course, other courses, or through other experiences."
